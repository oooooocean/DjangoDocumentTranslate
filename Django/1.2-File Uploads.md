# File Uploads

When Django handles a file upload, the file data ends up placed in `request.FILES`, which is a dictionary containing a key for each `FileField` (or ImageField, or other FileField subclass) in the form. 

> 两个条件:
> 1. POST 请求.
> 2. encyppe="multipart/form-data".

```
django.http
	| HttpResponseRedirect
```

## Handling


```python
form = UploadFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
if form.is_valid(): 
	f = request.FILES['file']
	with open('some/file/name.txt', 'wb+') as destination:
        for chunk in f.chunks():
            destination.write(chunk)
```

> Looping over UploadedFile.chunks() instead of using read() ensures that large files don’t overwhelm your system’s memory.


If you’re saving a file on a Model with a FileField, using a `ModelForm` makes this process much easier. The file object will be saved to the location specified by the `upload_to` argument of the corresponding FileField when calling form.save():

```python
form = ModelFormWithFileField(request.POST, request.FILES)
if form.is_valid():
    form.save()

# or
form = UploadFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
if form.is_valid():
    instance = ModelWithFileField(file_field=request.FILES['file'])
    instance.save()
```

## Uploading multiple files

## Custom upload handlers
When a user uploads a file, Django passes off the file data to an `upload handler` – a small class that handles file data as it gets uploaded. Upload handlers are initially defined in the `FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS` setting, which defaults to:

```
["django.core.files.uploadhandler.MemoryFileUploadHandler",
 "django.core.files.uploadhandler.TemporaryFileUploadHandler"]
```
